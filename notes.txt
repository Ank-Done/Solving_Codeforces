Today I participated in my first codeforces contest for div 2-1. It was cool. 
I was able to solve 1 problem out of the 6 available and I am still in the process of solving more problems similar to those appearing in the competition. 
They defenetly put a challenge on me. 
Hope to one day be able to solve even harder ones.

My  journey in CS continues, I have stopped to develop solutions in Codeforeces;
I do not think that my passion has decreased, I just wanted to understand bette multiple methods,
and librares for me tu utilize in these problems,
I want to have a bertter understanding into data structures,
and the use of ponters so I can manage my applications
in a better way
